## README: Project Setup and Workflow

## Project Overview


### Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository:

```Bash
git clone --single-branch --branch develop <repository_url>
```

- This will clone only the develop branch, ensuring you start with the latest development version.

### Development Workflow

- Create a Feature Branch:

```Bash
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
```

- Replace my-feature with a descriptive name for your feature.

### Make Changes:

- Edit code files as needed.
- Commit changes frequently with clear commit messages:

```Bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature X"
```

### Push to Remote Repository:

```Bash
git push origin feature/my-feature
```

### Create a Pull Request:

- Open a pull request targeting the develop branch.
- Provide a clear description of the changes made.
- Code Review and Merge:

- Once approved, merge the pull request into the develop branch.
